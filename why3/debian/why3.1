.SH DESCRIPTION
This manual page summarizes basic information about the \fBwhy3\fR command.
Please refer to the Reference Manual for complete information.

Why3 is a platform for deductive program verification. It provides a
rich language for specification and programming, called whyml, and
relies on external theorem provers, both automated and interactive, to
discharge verification conditions. Why3 comes with a standard library
of logical theories (integer and real arithmetic, Boolean operations,
sets and maps, etc.) and basic programming data structures (arrays,
queues, hash tables, etc.). A user can write whyml programs directly
and get correct-by-construction OCaml programs through an automated
extraction mechanism. whyml is also used as an intermediate language
for the verification of C, Java, or Ada programs.

.SH "COMMANDS"
.TP
\fBconfig\fR Creates a why3 configuration file \fI~/.why3.conf\fR,
containing in particular information about available provers and
plugins. If this file exists already, config
will only reset unset variables to default value, but will not try to
detect provers.

The command option \fB--detect-provers\fR can be used to force Why3 to
detect again the available provers and to replace them in the
configuration file. The command option \fB--detect-plugins\fR does the
same for plugins.

If a supported prover is installed under a name that is not
automatically recognized by why3 config, the command option \fB--add-prover\fR 
adds a specified binary to the configuration. For example, an Alt-Ergo
executable /home/me/bin/alt-ergo-trunk can be added as follows:

  why3 config --add-prover alt-ergo /home/me/bin/alt-ergo-trunk

.TP
\fBdoc\fR
produces HTML pages from Why3 source code.
.TP
\fBexecute\fR
symbolically executes programs written in the WhyML language
.TP
\fBextract\fR
extracts OCaml code from programs written in the WhyML language
.TP
\fBide\fR
launches the graphical user interface of the why3 platform.

There are no specific command options. However, at least one
command argument must be given. More
precisely, the first argument must be the directory of the
session. If the directory does not exist, it is created. The other
arguments should be existing files that are going to be added to the
session. For convenience, if there is only one argument, it
can be an existing file and in this case the session directory is
obtained by removing the extension from the file name.

.TP
\fBprove\fR
launches \fBwhy3\fR in batch mode on a an input file
.TP
\fBrealize\fR
produces skeleton files for proof assistants
.TP
\fBreplay\fR
executes the proofs stored in a Why3 session file, as produced by the IDE.
.TP
\fBsession\fR
.TP
\fBwc\fR
produces statistics about Why3 and WhyML source codes.
