Abstract: Why3 is a platform for deductive program verification. It provides
 a rich language for specification and programming, called whyml, and
 relies on external theorem provers, both automated and interactive,
 to discharge verification conditions. Why3 comes with a standard
 library of logical theories (integer and real arithmetic, Boolean
 operations, sets and maps, etc.) and basic programming data structures
 (arrays, queues, hash tables, etc.). A user can write whyml programs
 directly and get correct-by-construction OCaml programs through an
 automated extraction mechanism. whyml is also used as an intermediate
 language for the verification of C, Java, or Ada programs.
