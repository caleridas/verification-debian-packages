why3 (1.1.0-1) unstable; urgency=medium

  * New upstream version. Works with cvc4 version 1.6 (closes: #906001)
  * Since lablgtk2 does no longer build liblablgtksourceview2-ocaml-dev:

      liblablgtksourceview2-ocaml-dev

why3 (1.0.0-2) unstable; urgency=medium

  * as-installed test why3+cvc4:
    - dropped erroneous version constraint on cvc4.
    - invoke prover simply as CVC4
    - marked test as skip-not-installable, instead of flaky, as cvc4 does not
      build on all architectures (architecture restriction set in src:cvc4),
      and since cvc4 is only an alternative dependency of why3.
  * as-installed test why3+cvc3:
    - marked test as skip-not-installable, instead of flaky, since cvc3
      recently has FTBFS, and since cvc3 is only an alternative dependency
      of why3.
  * as-installed-test why3+spass:
    - marked test as skip-not-installable since spass recently has FTBFS
      issues and was dropped from testing, and since spass is only an
      alternative dependency of why3.
