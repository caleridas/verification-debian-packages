+ Coq package for Debian +
--------------------------


Packaging a new upstream version
--------------------------------

Coq documentation may be distributed only subject to the terms and
conditions set forth in the Open Publication License, v1.0 or later,
which is not DFSG-compliant. See:

  http://lists.debian.org/debian-legal/2004/03/msg00226.html

Only coqdoc-generated documentation of the standard library is shipped
in main. The full documentation is shipped in non-free (as coq-doc
package).

The git-import-orig tool automatically filters out problematic files,
thanks to the configuration in debian/gbp.conf. It is suggested to
append the "dfsg" suffix to the upstream version to make repackaging
explicit.


Patch system
------------

This source package is in format 3.0 (quilt).

The quilt series, if any, is generated from the Git repository, using
dom-{apply,save}-patches, from the dh-ocaml (>= 0.5) package. Please
refer to the appendix about Git in the Debian OCaml Packaging Policy
(from the same package).


Version Control System
----------------------

Packaging is versioned with git, using git-import-orig (with
--pristine-tar option) and git-buildpackage (with --git-pristine-tar
option). Debian changelog can be updated based on git changelog using
git-dch. Please consider reading the documentation of these tools.

It was versioned with subversion until Wed, 23 Jul 2008.


Build cache
-----------

Since Coq takes so much time to compile, there is a build cache to
speed-up Debian development and debugging. Just copy a previous build
to ../coq.cache, and debian/rules will detect its presence and rsync
from there instead of really compiling Coq...
