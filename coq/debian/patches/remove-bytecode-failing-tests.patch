Subject: Disable tests which require ocamlopt
Forwarded: not-needed

Disable unit tests. They require ocamlopt, which isn't available on all
Debian architectures, and GaÃ«tan Gilbert says that "they don't test much
yet" anyway.

Also disable .vio tests, as they run afoul
of https://github.com/coq/coq/issues/9141.
