Description: proof assistant for higher-order logic (toplevel and compiler)
 Coq is a proof assistant for higher-order logic, which allows the
 development of computer programs consistent with their formal
 specification. It is developed using Objective Caml and Camlp5.
 .
 This package provides coqtop, a command line interface to Coq.
 .
 The proofgeneral package allows proofs to be edited using Emacs and
 XEmacs.

Description: proof assistant for higher-order logic (theories)
 Coq is a proof assistant for higher-order logic, which allows the
 development of computer programs consistent with their formal
 specification. It is developed using Objective Caml and Camlp5.
